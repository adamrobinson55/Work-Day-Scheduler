# Work-Day-Scheduler

## What It Does

This website displays a the current date and a list of work day hours. The hours color change based on whether the hour is in the past, present or future. There is an area where the user can write text and then save it to local storage by pressing the save button.

Most of my input to this website was in the form of JavaScript, I did change the tagnames and IDs of some elements in HTML to make the JavaScript side run easier. In javascript is added event listeners using JQuery to all the underordered list, then the code checks if you clicked on an element with the 'button' tag this allows users to save when they click the button. One thing I struggled with on this assignment was adding data to local storage, I ended up saving the data using the id of the element that it would later be retrieved to, which is another piece I struggled with, adding the text back from local storage to the textareas.
